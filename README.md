### Passage, Aimé Césaire

It is the obligatory passage that from here I reject  
a final listing  
a rumination of ebb tides  
the inventory as well of the length of droughts  
on the flaccid teats of the pitons.  

sufficiently attested by the very configuration of the miracle  
the irrecusable slope of vomit  

cirques and creeks  
ultimate synthesis of corridors and sills  
I know that I am responsible  
for the impatience of a springtime of mistaken tracks  
to keep  
the intact  
to keep the living  
&emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&nbsp;magma of the word stronger for its silences
