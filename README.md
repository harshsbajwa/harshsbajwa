hey, my name is harsh. i'm an undergraduate at the university of toronto, studying computer science.  

i'm interested in everything human, so, naturally, i'm interested in design, accessibility, and humanâ€“computer interaction.

besides that, i cannot get enough of art, history, math and philosophy.

this is my github. take a look around and explore, see what exists (and what doesn't).
